Explanation
====================================================================

For this project, I've used alglib for the basic math calculation 
such as barycentric calculation. So to compile this project this 
library is needed so don't erase the folder.

For Assignment 3, Click Method and from the drop down menu, click 
Assignment 3 - Polynomial Interpolation and from that drop down menu, 
select Polynomial.

For the output, we can see the curve that goes through the points that
users clicked. No shells or no polylines are drawn in this section.

====================================================================
Controls for Assignment3
====================================================================
Right Mouse - Move the point that is clicked(Or Nearest point)
Left Mouse - Generate the point where user clicked

File - It has Clear and exit menu.
