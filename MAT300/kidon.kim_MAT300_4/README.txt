For this project, I've used alglib for the basic math calculation 
such as barycentric calculation. So to compile this project this 
library is needed so don't erase the folder.

Assignment 4 - Spline Interpolation and from that drop down menu, 
select Splines.

For the output, the Black curve line is the final curve that we want to see.
