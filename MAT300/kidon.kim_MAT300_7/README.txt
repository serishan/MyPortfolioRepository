====================================================================
Explanation
====================================================================

For this project, I've used alglib for the basic math calculation 
such as barycentric calculation. So to compile this project this 
library is needed so don't erase the folder.

For Assignment 7, Click Method and from the drop down menu, click 
Assignment 7 - DeBoor Algorithm for B-Spline Curvess and from that 
drop down menu, select DeBoor.

For the output, the Black curve line is the final curve that we want to see.
The blue lines are poly lines that connects the points.
The Red lines are the shells that are used for calculating the final result.
If you don't want to see one of the line, click View from the menu and uncheck the 
part that you don't want to see. For instance, if you don't want to see the 
red line(shell), then uncheck the shell menu. 

====================================================================
Controls for Assignment2
====================================================================
Right Mouse - Move the point that is clicked(Or Nearest point)
Degree[Bottom-right corner] - This is the degree for the curve.
S[Bottom-right corner] - This Changes the number of points
Continuity[Left-bottom corner] - If this is checked, it will show
                                  all the curve if not, it will show
                                  disconnected curve.
Knot Seq[Bottom of screen] - This shows knot sequence or continuity.
                             If the Continuity is checked, it will show 
                             Continuity of each points. If not, it will 
                             show knot sequence.

[ Menus at the top of the application ]
View - It holds all of the visualization part.
Method - It holds the method of the application that is showing on the screen.
File - It has Clear and exit menu.
