Explanation
====================================================================

For this project, I've used alglib for the basic math calculation 
such as barycentric calculation. So to compile this project this 
library is needed so don't erase the folder.

For Assignment 1, Click Method and from the drop down menu, click 
Assignment 1 - Coefficient Polynomial and from that drop down menu, 
select DeCastlejau.

For the output, the Black curve line is the final curve that we want to see.
The blue lines are poly lines that connects the points.
The Red lines are the shells that are used for calculating the final result.
If you don't want to see one of the line, click View from the menu and uncheck the 
part that you don't want to see. For instance, if you don't want to see the 
red line(shell), then uncheck the shell menu.
